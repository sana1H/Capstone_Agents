# 👔 AURA — AI-Powered Wardrobe Recommendation System

> **AURA** is a multi-agent AI system that delivers personalized outfit recommendations by combining wardrobe data, real-time weather, occasion, mood, and individual style preferences. Instead of relying on a single LLM prompt, specialized AI agents collaborate to make recommendations that are more explainable, consistent, and context-aware.

# 📖 Overview

Selecting an outfit is rarely a simple choice. Factors such as **weather**, **occasion**, **personal style**, **mood**, and **available wardrobe items** all influence what someone should wear.

AURA approaches this problem through a **multi-agent architecture**, where each AI agent specializes in understanding one aspect of the recommendation process. Their outputs are then combined by an orchestration pipeline to generate an outfit recommendation along with transparent reasoning and a compatibility score.

This modular design makes the system easier to extend, debug, and improve compared to traditional single-prompt solutions.

# 🏗️ System Architecture

AURA follows a sequential multi-agent workflow orchestrated using **LangGraph**.
